Great! Let's create a simple cross-platform news feed app with a GUI using C++14. 

We'll use the Qt framework for the GUI, which is cross-platform and widely used. 

For the API, we'll use a news API like NewsAPI.org to fetch news articles.

Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

1.	Set up your project:
•	Install Qt and set up your development environment.
•	Create a new Qt Widgets Application project in Visual Studio.

2.	Add dependencies:
•	Ensure you have the necessary Qt modules (QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets, QtNetwork).

3.	Design the GUI:
•	Use Qt Designer to create a simple interface with a search bar, a button, and a list view to display news articles.

4.	Fetch and display news articles:
•	Use Qt's QNetworkAccessManager to make HTTP requests to the NewsAPI.
•	Parse the JSON response and display the articles in the list view.
